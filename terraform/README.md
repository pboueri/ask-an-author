# Terraform Running Notes


- I have set up a [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/index.html) account to manage remote state
- I have set up an aws account to provision resources
- I have walked through the terraform [tutorial here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro)


## Running TODO

- Figure out what resources this project will need
- Write sample terraform scripts to spin the up
- Figure out the best way to spin up an AWS resource with a built docker image? I imagine it's separate, but maybe it can be included? What does CD look like w/ versioned terraform?

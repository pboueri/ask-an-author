# ask-an-author
Ask your favorite author for life advice

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to learn a couple things, namely:

    - Terraform
    - AWS's new ML offerings
    - New NLP Models and transfer learning
    - My deepest questions from my favorite authors

to do this I will be collecting, training, and building models that represent authors I like, and then exposing them through a question answering services for folks to ask questions. Not sure if it's novel, but it'll certainly be fun!
